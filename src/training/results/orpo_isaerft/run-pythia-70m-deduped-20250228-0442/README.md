# Model Card for PYTHIA-70M-DEDUPED-FT-ORPO-ISAERFT_run-pythia-70m-deduped-20250228-0442

This model is a fine-tuned version of [EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/pythia-70m-deduped).
It has been trained using [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl).

## Quick start

```python
from transformers import pipeline

question = "If you had a time machine, but could only go to the past or the future once and never return, which would you choose and why?"
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="AMindToThink/PYTHIA-70M-DEDUPED-FT-ORPO-ISAERFT_run-pythia-70m-deduped-20250228-0442", device="cuda")
output = generator([{"role": "user", "content": question}], max_new_tokens=128, return_full_text=False)[0]
print(output["generated_text"])
```

## Training procedure

 


This model was trained with ORPO, a method introduced in [ORPO: Monolithic Preference Optimization without Reference Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.07691).

- TRL: 0.15.1
- Transformers: 4.49.0
